    Combustion engine performance and efficiency are greatly impacted by variations in air quality, such as particulate 
    matter (small solid particles and liquid droplets hanging in the air), humidity, and oxygen levels, can also upset 
    the precise air-fuel mixture that a combustion engine’s performance relies on. Particulates like dust and soot can 
    build up inside the engine therefore increase wear inside the engine this wear will then decrease the performance 
    and if unattended will eventually cause malfunctions. Overly high humidity can lower the oxygen density of the air,
    which lowers engine overall power and efficiency. On the other hand, air that is high in oxygen can improve engine 
    performance but has a negative impact on the environment as it worsens nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, which
    increases air pollution. The lifespan and performance figures of an engine can be improved by refining engine
    design and creating advanced air filtering systems.

    In my study I will be talking about the main factor that can decrease an engine's performance over time, which
    is wear and tear caused by poor maintenance in the form of unregular filter replacement. Another area that 
    was of focus during my research was on how air humidity affects performance figures of engines and how it participates
    in accelerating the buildup of debris inside air filters and therefore causing thei lifespan to drastically decrease.

    Accumulation of particulate matter in an engine’s air filter’s is the key area that causes wear and tear inside an 
    engine this is proven in a 2018 study which found that dust, which is sucked with air into engine cylinders, only
    partly takes part in destructive influence on engine elements. The authors of <a href= "#[1]">[1]</a>state that about 30% of the 
    pollutants getting with the air into the engine super-piston space may get out in basically the same form with 
    the exhaust gases from cylinders to the exhaust system. These particles, although small, when accelerated to a 
    high velocity through the turbines can cause scratches on the engine’s pistons which overtime cause gaps for air 
    and fuel to escape and decrease the engine’s maximum power output.
                    
    Figure 1 shows the Effect of particle size on wear rate of cylinder liner and piston ring.
    Figure made by the authors of source <a href= "#[2]">[2]</a>
    <img src="Picture1.png" alt="Figure1" width="600" height="300">
                    
    In this figure it is observed that particles larger than 6µm have no increasing effect at damaging the piston’s 
    ring and sleeve, and particles between 0 and 2 µm did very minimal damage. Therefore, our focus on air intake 
    filtration should be aimed at reducing particles of the size 2µm and larger this can be done using High-Efficiency 
    Particulate Air (HEPA) Filters. These filters can trap particles as small as 0.3 µm with an efficiency of 99.97%. 
    and are also 99.9% effective at trapping particles larger than 1 µm <a href= "#[4]">[4]</a>. If particulates any larger than 1 µm are
    kept out of our engines this means that almost no damage at all will be done to engine components die to unfiltered 
    air and will increase the lifespan of our engines drastically. These filters are used in high-performance and luxury
    vehicles but in the near future they will become cheaper and more easily accessible to all vehicle owners.

    Air humidity is another factor of air quality that can play a significant role in a combustion engine’s power output.
    This loss in power could be due to various factors like the reduction in oxygen density, a reduction in fuel 
    efficiency and negative impacts on air filtration systems. Humid air contains a higher proportion of water vapor, 
    which displaces oxygen molecules therefore the air has a lower oxygen content which disrupts the precise balance of 
    air-fuel mixture required for maximum power output. This disruption in the air-fuel mixture causes the engine to be 
    less efficient and therefore burns up more fuel to maintain the same power output. Air humidity is also a key factor 
    in the common clogging  of air filtration systems as the water vapour in the air can cause condensation to occur 
    inside a engine’s air filters the condensation mixed with the particulates captured by the air filter causes blockages 
    and reduce the filter’s efficiency, this allows particles to enter the engine which as mentioned before can be harmful
    to the engine’s components.
                    
    Figure2. showing how humidity in the air affects the rate of heat released during combustion inside the engine.
    <img src="Picture2.png" alt="Figure2" width="600" height="300">
                    
    As seen in Figure2.due to water having significantly higher specific heat capacity, it increases the specific heat 
    capacity of the ignition substance which results in lower compression and combustion temperatures, respectively. This 
    delays the auto-ignition event, thereby lowering the rate of heat release and lengthening combustion duration <a href= "#[5]">[5]</a>. 
    Lengthened combustion durations reduce combustion efficiency of the engine as it does not reach the required temperature 
    for complete combustion to occur, therefore the full amount of fuel is not utilized, and the engine’s power is limited 
    because of this. As fuel is unutilized the engine uses a larger volume of fuel to produce the same power figures, this 
    causes a significant increase in fuel consumption and operational cost.
    There are solutions to this problem such as modern variable ignition timing and adaptive combustion strategies, but
    these are still in their early stages and are currently very expensive systems which are only utilized in the most 
    modern engines. 

    Figure3. shows difference in combustion duration with different Oxygen concentrations of air at Different Engine Power 
    outputs. <a href= "#[6]">[6]</a>
    <img src="Picture3.png" alt="Banner" width="600" height="300">

    The humidity in air causes it to displace oxygen molecules which causes a lower percentage of oxygen in the air, 
    figure3 investigates the duration taken for the engine to produce certain power outputs at a constant 1500rpm, as seen
    in figure 3 air with lower oxygen percentage takes a longer time to produce the same amount of power as that of air
    with high oxygen percentages.

                <pre id="Conclusion_InText">
    In conclusion I believe my research has identified what areas of air filters need improvements to benefit customers as 
    air filtration is one of the key parts of maintaining our engines healthy, another area which may need improvements is 
    an improvement to moisture filtration as it can clog up air filters and shorten their life span. This research can be 
    used by engine and air filter manufacturers to understand how their products are currently operating and how they can 
    be improved. To further develop this research, it may be beneficial to investigate how different types of particulates
    damage engine components and how different climates around the world have their own needs in engine air filtration as this 
    can be a key advertising strategy for manufacturers.
    This research can also be utilized by other industries as there are various uses of air filters such as in machines like: 
    chainsaws, clothe driers, kawn mowers, air conditioners and many oter commonly used machines.
